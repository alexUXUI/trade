📌 Key Factors to Consider in Trade Strength Calculation
Factor	Why It Matters?
Risk/Reward Ratio (RRR)	Higher RRR = More reward for risk taken. Ideal RRR: 2+
Leverage Used	Higher leverage = Higher risk of liquidation. Ideal: Moderate leverage (5x-15x)
Liquidation Price Distance	Closer liquidation = More risk. Ideal: Liquidation far from entry price.
Margin Allocation (%)	Using too much balance = Overexposure. Ideal: Max 10-30% of available balance.
Stop Loss Distance	Too tight = Stopped out easily. Too loose = Big losses. Ideal: Balanced SL distance.
Fees Impact on Profit	High fees can reduce profitability. Ideal: Low fees relative to profit.
🔹 Business Logic for "Trade Strength" Rating
1️⃣ Risk-Reward Ratio (RRR) [30% Weight]

RRR < 1.5 → Weak (-2 pts)
RRR 1.5 - 2.5 → Good (+3 pts)
RRR > 2.5 → Strong (+5 pts)
2️⃣ Leverage Used [20% Weight]

Leverage > 25x → Very Risky (-3 pts)
Leverage 10x-25x → Moderate Risk (+2 pts)
Leverage < 10x → Safe (+5 pts)
3️⃣ Liquidation Price Distance [20% Weight]

Liquidation <5% from Entry → High Risk (-3 pts)
Liquidation 5-15% from Entry → Moderate Risk (+2 pts)
Liquidation >15% from Entry → Safe (+4 pts)
4️⃣ Margin Allocation [15% Weight]

Using >50% of Available Balance → Overexposed (-3 pts)
Using 10-50% of Available Balance → Balanced (+3 pts)
Using <10% of Available Balance → Conservative (+5 pts)
5️⃣ Stop Loss Distance [10% Weight]

SL < 1% from Entry → Too Tight (-2 pts)
SL 1-5% from Entry → Balanced (+3 pts)
SL > 5% from Entry → Too Loose (-2 pts)
6️⃣ Fee Impact on Profit [5% Weight]

Fees > 10% of Profit → High Impact (-2 pts)
Fees 5-10% of Profit → Moderate (+2 pts)
Fees < 5% of Profit → Negligible (+3 pts)

Factor	Score	Reason
Risk/Reward Ratio (2.0)	+3	Good RRR
Leverage (25x)	+2	High but not extreme
Liquidation Distance ($2808 vs. $2700 entry, ~4% away)	-3	Too close to entry (High risk)
Margin Allocation (Unknown, assumed safe)	+3	Likely using <30% balance
Stop Loss Distance ($2970 vs. $2700 entry, ~10% away)	+3	Balanced SL distance
Fee Impact ($0.60 vs. $200 profit, ~0.3%)	+3	Negligible fees
Total Score = 11
Trade Strength: "Moderate" (🟡 Yellow)
